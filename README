Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI-SPECIFICATION) is a high-speed controller standard applicable to USB 2.0. 
The existence of UHCI and OHCI based systems, as existed previously, entailed greater complexity and costs than necessary. 
Consequently, the USB-IF insisted on a public specification for EHCI. 
Intel hosted EHCI conformance testing and this helped to prevent incursion of proprietary features
